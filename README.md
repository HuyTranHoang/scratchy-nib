# Scratchy Nib e-project

There are so many aspects of creating art that are fun an enjoyable – the practice, experimentation, and work to make each piece – that hours pass as if they were minutes. Sharing and engaging with the amazing writing community to help other create their own masterpieces is also incredibly rewarding.

Calligraphy has become very popular recently – examples of it can be seen in many advertising areas, restaurant menus, posters and even party invitations. It’s very loosely based on Copperplate calligraphy, which is a lot stricter in form and design.

Scratchy Nib is one place, which brings together the art of Calligraphy along with the knowledge and history.
